\chapter{Theory Description and Basic Metatheory}
\input{figures/02/typing_macros.tex}

This chapter describes the syntax, reduction, and type judgment of the core system for Cedille2.
Near the conclusion, this chapter also proves basic metatheoretic properties such as a weakening lemma, substitution lemma, classification, and preservation.
The presentation is a classical PTS-style with a single inference judgment.
As it stands it is not obvious how this judgment admits an inference algorithm, but this situation will be remedied in Chapter~\ref{chap:6}.
This style is chosen in particular because it prevents proofs of basic facts from becoming undesirably complex.
