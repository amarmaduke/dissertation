\chapter{Theory Description and Basic Metatheory}
\input{figures/02/typing_macros.tex}

This chapter describes the syntax, reduction, and inference judgment of the core system for Cedille2.
Basic metatheoretic properties such as a weakening, substitution, classification, and preservation are proven.
Additionally, important internal derivations are constructed demonstrating that the core theory is capable of deriving existing encodings from Cedille.
The presentation is a classical PTS-style with a single inference judgment.
