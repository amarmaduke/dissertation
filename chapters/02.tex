\chapter{Theory Description and Basic Metatheory}
\input{figures/02/typing_macros.tex}

This chapter describes the syntax, reduction, and inference judgment of the core system $\ced$.
Basic metatheoretic properties such as preservation and classification are proven.
Additionally, irrelevant casts and irrelevant views are constructed demonstrating that $\ced$ is capable of deriving existing encodings from Cedille.
The presentation is a standard PTS-style with a single inference judgment.
