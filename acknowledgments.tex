Thank you to my advisor, Aaron Stump, for your guidance and feedback throughout my time as a graduate student.
You enabled and nurtured my exploration into Cedille.
Thank you to everyone at the Computational Logic Center for a fun and welcoming environment, especially: Christa, Tony, Alex, and Apoorv.
In the office I have a hard time not bothering people with ideas and discussion, thank you for tolerating it.
Finally, thank you to my partner, Emily, for being here at the start of the journey and all the way to the end.
Your help through stressful times and tribulations was invaluable.
I could not imagine having done it without you.
