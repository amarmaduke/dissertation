\begin{theorem}
    If $\Gamma \vdash t \infr A$ then $\vdash \Gamma$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By induction on the proof derivation of $t$ with motive $\vdash \Gamma$ for all four mutually defined relations.

    Almost all cases are immediate by the IH.

$\text{Case: }\begin{array}{c} \ContextEmptyRule[*] \end{array}$
\begin{proofcase}
    If the context is empty then it is well-formed.
\end{proofcase}

$\text{Case: }\begin{array}{c} \ContextAppendRule[*] \end{array}$
\begin{proofcase}
    If the context is not empty then its derivation of well-formedness consists of the very data needed to show the full context is well-formed.
\end{proofcase}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    If $\Gamma \vdash t \cinfr A$ or $\Gamma \vdash t \chck A$ then $\vdash \Gamma$
\end{corollary}
